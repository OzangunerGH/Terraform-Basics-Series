This repository contains all the Terraform configurations that go along with my Terraform Basics series on dev.to — a hands-on, incremental walkthrough of building real infrastructure on Azure with Terraform.

Each week’s folder contains self-contained .tf files that align with the article for that week. Every lesson builds on top of the previous one, introducing a new concept or best practice as we go.
